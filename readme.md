# PingCastleDashboard

Generates an HTML dashboard to review the evolution of PingCastle scores and metrics using the XML files generated by PingCastle.

**This script requires the module `PSWriteHTML`.** You can install the module through PSGallery using `Install-Module PSWriteHTML`. More information about this module here: <https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML>

## How to use it?

You simply have to deposit the XML files generated by PingCastle in the `.\xml` folder and execute the `PingCastleDashboard.ps1` script. One report will be generated for each domain.

## Results

Default value is `.\output`

### -DateFormat

## UpdateHCRules

To add criticity scores to the healthcheck rules, the script uses the CSV file `HCRules.csv` which can be outdated. To update the file, you simply have to run the script `UpdateHCRules.ps1`. The script will parse the GitHub repository of the PingCastle project to get the latest healthcheck rules.
